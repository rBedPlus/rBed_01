### FOR TODAY:
# -- convert school_17_18.cnfW to school_17_18.txt
# -- convert school_19_20.cnfW to school_19_20.txt
# -- run brkga with instanceDef=school_17_18.txt  (it should stop on valueTarget = 10.5)
# -- run brkga with instanceDef=school_19_20.txt  (it should stop on valueTarget < 100)
# -- run brkga with instanceDef=school_19_20.txt  AND instance valueTarget=valueBest from previous run
# -- run brkga with instanceDef=school_19_20.txt  AND instance valueTarget=valueBest from previous run
#    ... etc etc
# -- then update THIS file with
#    glob[['school_17_20.txt']]    = best-known-value
#    glob[['school_19_20.cnfW']]   = best-known-value
#    
# â€” then run your ga-version on both
#    school_17_18.txt and school_19_20.txt
# with valueTarget from THIS file 
#   
   
### after we discuss, add all MISSING vaules from thisDir/*.cnfU, thisDir/*.cnfW, ihisDir/*.txtU, thisDir/*.txt
